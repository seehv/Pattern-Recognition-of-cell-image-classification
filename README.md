# Pattern-Recognition-of-cell-image-classification

HEp-2 cells is a recommended methodology to diagnose autoimmune diseases. However, manual analysis of images leads to crucial limitations, such as the subjectivity of result, the inconsistence across laboratories, and the low efficiency in processing a large number of cell images to come tp a conclusion. This is a classfication probelem and can be either of this 6 types
+ Homogeneous
+ Speckled
+ Nucleolar
+ Centromere
+ NuMem
+ Golgi

We might be aware what each image of cells represent using the .csv file in the dataset but we can't use this information to train our classifer. So this is addressed as an unsupervised learning technique and should be achieved using some clustering techniques.
